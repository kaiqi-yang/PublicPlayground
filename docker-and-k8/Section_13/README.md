198. Running Containers with Deployments
6min

- `Deployments`
  - Another kind of `objects`
    - `Pods`
      - Runs one or more closely related containers
    - `Services`
      - Sets up networking in a Kubernetes Cluster
    - `Deployment`
      - Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number exists. 

- Pods vs Deployments
  - `Pods`
    - Runs a single set of containers
    - Good for one-off dev purposes
    - Rarely used directly in production
  - `Deployments`
    - Runs a set of identical pods (one or more)
    - Monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary
    - Good for dev
    - Good for production
    - Pod Template
